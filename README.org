* man-1.5h1

The stack trace for the bug manifest:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
manfile.c:my_lith
manfile.c:glob_for_file_ext_glob
manfile.c:glob_for_file_ext
manfile.c:glob_for_file
manfile.c:manfile_from_sec_and_dir
manfile.c:manfile_from_section
manfile.c:manfile
man.c:get_section_list
man.c:main
#+END_EXAMPLE

Procedure:
1. crash the original program
2. patch the original program, run the bug triggering input
3. find the full crash stack
4. along that stack, remove statements, every time remove some, test the bug triggering input on it. Ensure:
   1. bug is triggered (at the same place)
   2. no bug for patched version (for the signature program)

Some insights
1. call graph is important
2. follow crash stack is useful
   only remove along the crash stack (dynamic symptom manifest stack)
3. not necessary to keep the AST structure.
   e.g. sometimes remove the if conditional structure entirely, but only keep one statement in the true branch.
4. keep the whole program, from the main function, so that we can utilize the bug triggering input.
   This will benefit a lot for the oracle.
